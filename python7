To solve this problem, we need to determine whether Alice's score 
𝑋
X is at least twice Bob's score 
𝑌
Y. If it is, Alice is happy, and we should print "Yes"; otherwise, we should print "No".

Solution Explanation
Input: Read two integers, 
𝑋
X (Alice's score) and 
𝑌
Y (Bob's score).
Comparison: Check if 
𝑋
≥
2
×
𝑌
X≥2×Y.
Output:
Print "Yes" if 
𝑋
≥
2
×
𝑌
X≥2×Y.
Print "No" if 
𝑋
<
2
×
𝑌
X<2×Y.
Constraints
The constraints 
1
≤
𝑋
,
𝑌
≤
100
1≤X,Y≤100 ensure that the input values are within a manageable range and can be processed efficiently.

Implementation
Here's the Python code to solve this problem:

python

# Read input values
X, Y = map(int, input().strip().split())

# Determine if Alice is happy
if X >= 2 * Y:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
